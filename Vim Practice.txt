==> Ctags Tutorial 
    Ctags is a tool that makes it easy to navigate large source code projects.
    
    ++ Ctags with Vim 
        1. cd to the root directory of your codebase 
            $ cd /github/requests 
        2. Run Ctags recursively over the entire kernel to generate the tags file. 
            $ ctags -R . 
        3. To Search for a specific tag and open Vim to its definition, run the following command in your shell 
            $ vim -t <tag>
        4. Open any source file in Vim and use the following basic commands 
            Ctrl + ] : Jump to the tag underneath the cursor 
            Ctrl + t : Jump back up in the tag stack 
            :ts <tag>: Search for a particular tag
            :tn     : Go to the next definition for the last tag 
            :tp     : Go to the previous definition for the last tag 
            :ts     : List all of the definitions of the last tag 
            
        The first command is probably the one you will use most often: it jumps to the definition of the tag(function name, structure name, variable name, or pretty much anything) under the cursor. The second command can be used to search for any tag, regardless of the file that is currently opened. If there are multiple definitions/uses for the tn and tp commands can be used to scrool through them, and the ts command can be used to "search" a list for the definition you want (useful when there are dozens or hundreds of definitions for some commandly-used struct). Finally, the last command is used to jump back up in the tag stack to the location you initiated the previous tags search from.
